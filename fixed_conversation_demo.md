### ✅ **"More Details" Fix:**
- **Problem:** Was showing generic fallback
- **Solution:** Now retrieves actual KB content from session state

## 📊 **Technical Implementation:**

```python
# Fix 1: Session state for "More details"
session_state.last_retrieved = retrieved_text
session_state.last_sources = sources

# Fix 2: Ticket confirmation tracking
session_state.awaiting_ticket_confirmation = True

# Fix 3: Smart response handling
if session_state.awaiting_ticket_confirmation:
    if "yes" in query.lower():
        # Create ticket
        return ticket_created_response
```
